# Facebook Posts by News Media: Data Analysis

This project aims at analysing and visualizing data downloaded from the facebook API. Datasets were originally downloaded by Patrick Martinchek, which can be downloaded [here](https://data.world/martinchek/2012-2016-facebook-posts). The data contains Facebook texts posted by 15 news agencies during 2012-2016. More about the data can be found in the link above. There is already some data analysis done by Patrick who focused on the media-bias towards US presidential candidates in 2016 election. The current project aims at extracting more information out of these datasets. Precise questions are coming soon...
